# Android Calculator using Kotlin

I have tried to use this project to better learn android studio and kotlin programming language. I am excited and want to keep learning this software and eventually develop apps. I really enjoyed coding this project even though it was simple in nature.

My app is a simple calculator. It uses a Linear layout design in Android studion with one Vertical and the rest horizontal. It adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides. There is also a clear screen button. I did not use additional addins to help with the calculations. Put simply the app gets the input from the button that the user presses and then it displays that string in the window. After the user put in all parts of the equation and presses equals, the program splits the string by the operator, converts it to a number, preforms the calculation and then outputs to a function that removes the decimal and zero only if it is a whole number. Then the answer is printed on the screen.

My purpose for creating this app is just simply to gain more knowledge about android studio, kotlin and programming in general.

# Development Environment

Kotlin programming language
Android Studio
Git / GitHub

The tools used in this project was mainly android studio. Android studio is a fairly straight forward IDE used to build android apps. It has a bit of a steep learning curve for certain parts, but for the designing of the app interface it used a simple language similar to css.

The Programming language that I used was kotlin. It is very similar to Java, but is more sleak and efficient. Google announced that Kotlin is the official language of android developers.

# Future Work

* There is a minor bug when you divide by zero where the answer comes back as infinity rather than zero
* add further calcuation actions such as number squared and square root
* add history to calculator
